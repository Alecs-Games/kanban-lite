# kanban_lite

A simple and elegant task management app made while learning Flutter. Supports offline sync using Firebase and real-time updates across multiple devices.
The project is very lightweight since it is mostly rendered with CustomPaint rather than built-in widgets. 
Still need to add: Security rules and sign-in for multiple users.
